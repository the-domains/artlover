description: Harris Street. Our uncle Kevin used to create accident scenarios with bikes piled up and place us underneath. I hated it. I much preferred the company of my friend Sarah. She loved to talk about Jesus and getting saved. The most fun of all was going down to the end of the block and hanging out with Mary and Harry Canet. We would watch Lawrence Welk and eat cookies in our superhero sleeping bags.
