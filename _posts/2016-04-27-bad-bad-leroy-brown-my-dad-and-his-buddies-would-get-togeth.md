description: "Bad bad Leroy Brown. My Dad and his buddies would get together all the time when I was young jam on their guitars, sing and smoke pot. I loved it. He also had an old Dodge from the 50's. He kept it running but it always needed some part that didn't exist. One day he took me with him in search of a part in this dusty, dirty scary junkyard with a terror of a dog. After visiting this place that reminded me of hell, whenever he would sing bad bad Leroy brown I conjured all these bad ass creatures in my head that lived in that yard. Definitely the wrong side of town for me. Recently I watched Picasso, and when he was making sculptures out of found pieces from a junk yard, I figure I should give it another go."
