My Dad and his buddies would get together all the time when I was young jam on their guitars, sing and smoke pot. I loved it. He also had an old Dodge from the 50&#x27;s. He kept it running but it always needed some part that didn&#x27;t exist. One day he took me with him in search of a part in this dusty, dirty scary junkyard with a terror of a dog. After visiting this place that reminded me of hell, whenever he would sing bad bad Leroy brown I conjured all these bad ass creatures in my head that lived in that yard. Definitely the wrong side of town for me. Recently I watched Picasso, and when he was making sculptures out of found pieces from a junk yard, I figure I should give it another go.</p></div></div></div></div></section><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-1 title-size-xsmall d-i-b color-title p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  section-height-fullscreen text-align-left group-graphical-shape-circle  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="39"><div class="Component p-1 ls-fx-r j-c-end color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="40"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1 w-100p ls-w-60p max-w-768px" data-reactid="41"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="42"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="43"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0c1c5e65802e04185bf61d1cb9d42f48/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fcb0769bd0bc711dbfa4e4753660b6b52c5193196.jpg&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:45.361328125% 64.92829204693612%;" data-reactid="44"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/3ba4d5385e8aed9d5ddaab53f1a27be1/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fcb0769bd0bc711dbfa4e4753660b6b52c5193196.jpg&amp;width=1280" style="object-position:45.361328125% 64.92829204693612%;" data-reactid="45"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f10f204c8f3182a2162e48e90515ac2c/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fcb0769bd0bc711dbfa4e4753660b6b52c5193196.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:45.361328125% 64.92829204693612%;" data-reactid="46"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/50affd9b0e13502d0f8b5165ea3a4fe2/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fcb0769bd0bc711dbfa4e4753660b6b52c5193196.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:45.361328125% 64.92829204693612%;" data-reactid="47"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="2048" data-height="1534" data-ratio="1.3350717079530638" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0c1c5e65802e04185bf61d1cb9d42f48/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fcb0769bd0bc711dbfa4e4753660b6b52c5193196.jpg&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:45.361328125% 64.92829204693612%;" data-reactid="48"/></picture></div></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 w-100p ls-w-20p v-a-t" data-reactid="49"><!-- react-empty: 50 --><!-- react-empty: 51 --><!-- react-empty: 52 --><!-- react-empty: 53 --><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="54"><p data-reactid="55">Harris Street.

It felt like Disneyland had arrived in our hometown. It was NEW and filled with donuts, ice cream and Butterfingers. It was a hot afternoon in the summer of 1982, I had just returned from back to school shopping at Mervyn's and was sporting my new HUSKY's and winter coat. Our neighbor Ms. leaf had just payed me $2 to water her dirt, in hopes that a lawn would someday emerge. I had a pocket full of cash and was feeling particularly gangster. I wanted to treat myself to some candy and a donut. As I made my way through the electric doors I had a last minute change of plans. I zipped my coat all the way to the top and decided to "shop" with my sunglasses on. Why spend my hard earned cash when I had this stealth stealing machine winter coat filled with secret pockets on. I made my way through all of the aisles pretending to shop from a fake list and after about 45 minutes I made my way to the candy section and picked up a butterfinger, checked it off my bogus list and placed it in my secret pocket inside my coat. All the while whistling along to the Disney elevator music. I passed the registers coat zipped to the top, sunglasses on and blending in like a model Safeway shopper. The moment I walked out of the doors Task force Reno 911 was there to intercept me. The man handled me back to the secret room for questioning and a mug shot. I broke into tears and told the task force they had no idea who they were dealing with. My MOM, Vickie Cooper. She would whip me like a scene from the color Purple, jerk both my lungs out and cut my new coat into tiny pieces. My parents arrived shortly and escorted me out of the store, which I was never to return for at least one year. </p><picture>
