My Dad and his buddies would get together all the time when I was young jam on their guitars, sing and smoke pot. I loved it. He also had an old Dodge from the 50's. He kept it running but it always needed some part that didn't exist. One day he took me with him in search of a part in this dusty, dirty scary junkyard with a terror of a dog. After visiting this place that reminded me of hell, whenever he would sing bad bad Leroy brown I conjured all these bad ass creatures in my head that lived in that yard. Definitely the wrong side of town for me. Recently I watched Picasso, and when he was making sculptures out of found pieces from a junk yard, I figure I should give it another go.</p></div></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalColumn-f6ce4a3a-9ea0-4474-83a3-948972d335a9" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="37"><div class="Component ms-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="38"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ms-w-50p" data-reactid="39"><a class=" " href="harris-street-our-uncle-kevin-used-to-create-accident-scena" data-reactid="40"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="41"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="42"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0c1c5e65802e04185bf61d1cb9d42f48/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fcb0769bd0bc711dbfa4e4753660b6b52c5193196.jpg&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:45.361328125% 64.92829204693612%;" data-reactid="43"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/3ba4d5385e8aed9d5ddaab53f1a27be1/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fcb0769bd0bc711dbfa4e4753660b6b52c5193196.jpg&amp;width=1280" style="object-position:45.361328125% 64.92829204693612%;" data-reactid="44"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f10f204c8f3182a2162e48e90515ac2c/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fcb0769bd0bc711dbfa4e4753660b6b52c5193196.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:45.361328125% 64.92829204693612%;" data-reactid="45"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/50affd9b0e13502d0f8b5165ea3a4fe2/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fcb0769bd0bc711dbfa4e4753660b6b52c5193196.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:45.361328125% 64.92829204693612%;" data-reactid="46"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="2048" data-height="1534" data-ratio="1.3350717079530638" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0c1c5e65802e04185bf61d1cb9d42f48/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fcb0769bd0bc711dbfa4e4753660b6b52c5193196.jpg&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:45.361328125% 64.92829204693612%;" data-reactid="47"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="48"><!-- react-empty: 49 --><!-- react-empty: 50 --><!-- react-empty: 51 --><!-- react-empty: 52 --><!-- react-empty: 53 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="54"><p>Harris Street.

It felt like Disneyland had arrived in our hometown. It was NEW and filled with donuts, ice cream and Butterfingers. It was a hot afternoon in the summer of 1982, I had just returned from back to school shopping at Mervyn's
    and was sporting my new HUSKY's and winter coat. Our neighbor Ms. leaf had just payed me $2 to water her dirt, in hopes that a lawn would someday emerge. I had a pocket full of cash and was feeling particularly gangster. I wanted to treat myself to
    some candy and a donut. As I made my way through the electric doors I had a last minute change of plans. I zipped my coat all the way to the top and decided to "shop" with my sunglasses on. Why spend my hard earned cash when I had this stealth stealing
    machine winter coat filled with secret pockets on. I made my way through all of the aisles pretending to shop from a fake list and after about 45 minutes I made my way to the candy section and picked up a butterfinger, checked it off my bogus list
    and placed it in my secret pocket inside my coat. All the while whistling along to the Disney elevator music. I passed the registers coat zipped to the top, sunglasses on and blending in like a model Safeway shopper. The moment I walked out of the
    doors Task force Reno 911 was there to intercept me. The man handled me back to the secret room for questioning and a mug shot. I broke into tears and told the task force they had no idea who they were dealing with. My MOM, Vickie Cooper. She would
    whip me like a scene from the color Purple, jerk both my lungs out and cut my new coat into tiny pieces. My parents arrived shortly and escorted me out of the store, which I was never to return for at least one year. </p><picture>
